# Frequently Asked Questions

Quick answers to common questions about The Munkeler.

---

## General Questions

### What is The Munkeler?

The Munkeler is a social deduction game where players try to find the Munkeler (imposter) among them. One player doesn't see the secret word — can you figure out who? It's perfect for parties, game nights, and travel.

### How many players do I need?

**Minimum:** 3 players  
**Maximum:** 12 players  
**Recommended:** 4-8 players for the best experience

Special roles (Jester & Sheriff) require at least 4 players.

### Do I need internet to play?

**No!** The Munkeler works completely offline. You only need internet for:
- AI topic generation
- Downloading the app initially
- Watching rewarded ads for bonus AI generations

### What platforms is it available on?

Currently available on **Android** via Google Play Store. iOS version is planned for future release.

### Is the game free?

**Yes!** The Munkeler is completely free to play with:
- No ads during gameplay
- 1 free AI generation per day
- Optional rewarded ads for 5 bonus AI generations per day

## Gameplay Questions

### How does a typical game work?

1. **Setup** - Add 3-12 players and choose a topic
2. **Roles** - Everyone sees the secret word except the Munkeler
3. **Discussion** - Players give hints about the word
4. **Voting** - Vote to eliminate the suspected Munkeler
5. **Win** - Civilians catch the Munkeler, or the Munkeler guesses the word!

See our **[How to Play](HowToPlay)** page for detailed rules and demo video.

### What are special roles?

With **4+ players**, you can enable:

- **Jester** - Tries to get voted out to win (solo victory!)
- **Sheriff** - Can inspect one player's role during the game

These add strategic depth and unexpected twists!

### How does the Munkeler win?

The Munkeler can win by:
1. **Guessing the secret word correctly** (case/accents ignored)
2. **Surviving until only 2 players remain**

### How does the Sheriff's inspection work?

The Sheriff can tap a player's card during the round phase to reveal their role (Civilian, Munkeler, or Jester). This ability can only be used **once per game**, so use it wisely!

### Can the Jester win alone?

**Yes!** If the Jester gets eliminated during voting, they win solo — even if civilians catch the Munkeler. This creates interesting mind games!

### What happens in a voting tie?

If votes are tied, the game proceeds to a **revote** with only the tied players. If still tied after revote, no one is eliminated that round.

### Can I play with 2 players?

The minimum is 3 players. With only 2 players, the game mechanics don't work (one Munkeler + one civilian means the Munkeler is immediately obvious).

## AI Topics & Customization

### How does AI topic generation work?

The AI generator creates custom word lists based on your description. For example:
- "Famous scientists" → Newton, Einstein, Curie, etc.
- "Pizza toppings" → Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Olives, etc.
- "90s video games" → Mario 64, Pokémon, Crash Bandicoot, etc.

You choose the number of words (5-20) and difficulty level.

### How many AI generations do I get?

- **1 free generation per day**
- **Up to 5 bonus generations** by watching rewarded ads
- Total: 6 generations per day maximum

The counter resets at midnight in your timezone.

### Are AI-generated topics saved?

**Yes!** All AI-generated topics are automatically saved locally on your device. You can access them from the topic selection screen and use them anytime, even offline.

### Can I create topics manually without AI?

**Yes!** You can create custom topics by:
1. Going to Setup screen
2. Tapping "Custom Topic"
3. Adding a name and at least 3 words (comma-separated)

No AI generations used for manual topics.

### Can I edit or delete custom topics?

Currently, custom topics are saved but cannot be edited. You can create a new version with corrections. Topic management features are planned for future updates.

## Technical & Troubleshooting

### What are the minimum requirements?

**Android:**
- Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or higher
- ~50 MB storage space
- No internet required for offline play

### Why isn't the app loading?

Try these steps:
1. Force-close the app and reopen
2. Clear app cache (Settings → Apps → The Munkeler → Clear Cache)
3. Restart your device
4. Reinstall the app if issues persist

### The AI generator isn't working

Check:
- [x] Internet connection (required for AI generation)
- [x] Daily limit (1 free + 5 ad-based per day)
- [x] Try again in a few seconds (server may be busy)

If it still fails, the app will show a fallback error and you can use manual custom topics instead.

### How do I reset my game data?

Currently there's no in-app reset. To clear all data:
1. Android Settings → Apps → The Munkeler
2. Clear Storage (this removes player names, custom topics, settings)
3. Reopen the app for a fresh start

### Will there be an iOS version?

**Yes!** An iOS version is planned for future release. Follow the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Davidpereira2803/imposter-hunt) for updates.

## Tips & Strategy

### Any tips for playing as the Munkeler?

- Listen carefully to others' hints
- Mirror the group's confidence level
- Avoid giving specific details
- When in doubt, keep hints vague ("It's common" / "Everyone knows it")
- Make your guess when you're 70%+ confident

### How do I catch the Munkeler?

- Watch for vague or generic hints
- Notice if someone avoids direct descriptions
- Test players with follow-up questions
- Sheriff: save your inspection for when you have 2-3 suspects

### When should the Sheriff use their inspection?

**Best timing:**
- When you have 2-3 strong suspects
- Before a critical vote (to confirm/eliminate a suspect)
- Mid-game (not too early, not when obvious)

**Avoid:**
- Wasting it on random early guesses
- Saving it too late (Jester might get eliminated first)

### How do I play as the Jester?

- Act suspicious without being too obvious
- Give slightly off hints that draw attention
- Vote erratically or contradict yourself
- Make yourself a target, but don't confess outright
