## Role-Specific Strategies

### Playing as Civilian

**Your Goal:** Identify and eliminate the Munkeler

#### Basic Strategy

**Give Clear (But Not Obvious) Hints**
- Describe characteristics, not the word itself
- "It's round" ✅ vs "It's a ball" ❌
- "You eat it for breakfast" ✅ vs "It's cereal" ❌
- "It has four legs" ✅ vs "It's a chair" ❌

**Watch for Red Flags:**
- Extremely vague hints ("It exists", "People know it")
- Generic descriptions that fit many words
- Copying other players' hints
- Asking too many questions
- Being overly defensive when questioned

**Smart Questioning:**
- Ask follow-ups: "What color is it?" "Where would you find it?"
- See if they hesitate or contradict earlier hints
- Notice who avoids direct questions

**Coordination:**
- Build on others' hints to narrow it down
- If someone gives a perfect clue, acknowledge it
- Help new players with better hint examples

#### Advanced Tactics

**The Subtle Test**
- Give a hint that's slightly wrong but seems right
- Example: Secret word is "Apple" → say "It grows on vines"
- If someone agrees, they might be guessing

**Voting Psychology**
- Don't always vote first (you seem too eager)
- Vote with confidence, not hesitation
- Change your vote strategically to observe reactions

**Meta-Gaming**
- Remember who was Munkeler in previous rounds
- Notice playing patterns (some people are always vague)
- Track who gives consistently good vs generic hints

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Giving synonyms ("It's a feline" for "Cat")
- ❌ Being too specific early (Munkeler learns too much)
- ❌ Accusing without evidence (creates chaos)
- ❌ Trusting someone just because they're confident

### Playing as the Munkeler

**Your Goal:** Guess the word or survive to 2 players

#### Basic Strategy

**Listen Carefully**
- Take mental notes of every hint
- Look for patterns across multiple clues
- Combine hints to narrow possibilities

**Blend In**
- Mirror the confidence level of others
- Give vague hints that could apply to many things
- "It's pretty common" / "Most people have seen one"
- "It can be different colors" / "It depends on the type"

**Safe Generic Hints:**
- "It's useful"
- "You see it often"
- "It varies in size"
- "People have different opinions about it"
- "It's been around a long time"

**When to Guess:**
- You're 70-80% confident
- About to be eliminated (last chance)
- Only 3-4 players left (running out of time)

#### Advanced Tactics

**The Echo Strategy**
- Repeat parts of others' hints in different words
- "Yeah, it's commonly found" (echoing "common")
- Sounds like you know, but adds no new info

**The Question Deflector**
- When asked direct questions, deflect:
  - "Well, it depends how you look at it"
  - "I think [Player] explained it better"
  - "That's a good question, what do YOU think?"

**Controlled Risk-Taking**
- Occasionally give a semi-specific hint based on your guess
- If you think it's "Dog": "It's friendly" or "People keep them"
- Shows confidence, but safe if wrong (many things are friendly)

**Survival Mode (Late Game):**
- If you can't guess, focus on survival
- Deflect suspicion onto others
- Create doubt: "I think it's between [Player A] and [Player B]"
- Survive to 2 players = automatic win

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Asking too many questions (obvious tell)
- ❌ Being first to give hints (pressure to be specific)
- ❌ Guessing too early with <50% confidence
- ❌ Panicking when questioned (stay calm)
- ❌ Giving contradictory hints

**Pro Tip:** If you narrow it to 2-3 possibilities, pick the most common one. AI and built-in topics favor well-known items.

### Playing as Jester

**Your Goal:** Get voted out (without being obvious)

#### Basic Strategy

**Be Suspicious, Not Obvious**
- Don't confess you're the Munkeler (too easy)
- Give hints that are slightly off
- Act confused or contradict yourself subtly

**Controlled Suspicion:**
- "Wait, what was the question again?"
- Give a hint, then backtrack: "Actually, maybe not..."
- Vote erratically but not randomly

**Draw Attention:**
- Be defensive when questioned (looks guilty)
- Hesitate before answering
- Ask clarifying questions at weird times

#### Advanced Tactics

**The False Defense**
- Defend the actual Munkeler to seem like accomplices
- "I don't think [The Munkeler] is suspicious at all"
- Creates association in others' minds

**The Flip-Flop**
- Change your vote last-second
- Explains: "I changed my mind because..."
- Looks indecisive and suspicious

**The Overconfident Tell**
- Give a very specific hint early
- Then act nervous when people notice
- Seems like you slipped up (classic Munkeler mistake)

**Timing Your Act:**
- Early game: subtle suspicion
- Mid game: increase red flags
- Late game: be more obvious (before Munkeler is caught)

**The Reverse Psychology:**
- Say "I'm definitely NOT the Munkeler!"
- The more you insist, the guiltier you look

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Being too obvious (people will know you're Jester)
- ❌ Staying silent (won't get voted)
- ❌ Voting for yourself (dead giveaway)
- ❌ Acting suspicious after Munkeler is revealed (timing is wrong)

**Pro Tip:** The best Jester play is being suspicious enough to get voted, but not so obvious that people suspect you're the Jester.

### Playing as Sheriff

**Your Goal:** Help Civilians win by inspecting strategically

#### Basic Strategy

**When to Inspect:**
- **Not Round 1** - Not enough info yet
- **Mid-game (Round 2-3)** - After you have 2-3 suspects
- **Before Critical Vote** - Confirm suspicions before elimination

**Reading Inspections:**
- **Civilian** - Cleared, trust their hints
- **Munkeler** - Found them! Share immediately
- **Jester** - Don't reveal (they want elimination)

**Information Management:**
- Share the Munkeler findings immediately
- Keep Jester findings secret (don't help them win)
- Clear Civilians publicly to build trust

#### Advanced Tactics

**The Suspect List Method:**
1. Mentally rank players by suspicion (Round 1)
2. Narrow to top 2-3 suspects (Round 2)
3. Inspect #1 suspect before next vote
4. Share or act on findings

**The Bluff:**
- Pretend you haven't used inspection yet
- Munkeler might reveal themselves thinking you still have it
- Use it earlier than they expect

**The Silent Clear:**
- Inspect someone, find them Civilian
- Don't announce it immediately
- Watch if the Munkeler tries to frame them
- Reveal at perfect moment to expose the Munkeler

**The Jester Dilemma:**
- If you find the Jester early, don't reveal
- Steer votes away from Jester subtly
- Focus group on actual Munkeler
- Let Jester help confuse the Munkeler

**Protecting Your Identity:**
- Don't reveal you're Sheriff too early
- The Munkeler might guess and frame you
- Announce only when you have critical info

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Wasting inspection on random guess Round 1
- ❌ Revealing Jester (helps them win)
- ❌ Saving inspection too late (The Munkeler already caught/won)
- ❌ Inspecting the same person twice (impossible, but don't waste it on cleared player)

**Pro Tip:** Inspect the most confident player. Munkelers often overcompensate with confidence. True Civilians are naturally confident.

## Player Count Strategies

### 3-4 Players (Small Group)

**Dynamics:**
- Harder to hide as the Munkeler
- Fewer hints to learn from
- Votes matter more (each is 25-33%)
- Games faster (10 min)

**Civilian Strategy:**
- Be more direct with hints
- Process of elimination is powerful
- One or two good questions expose Munkeler

**The Munkeler Strategy:**
- Guess earlier (less info but more pressure)
- Can't blend in crowds
- Use confidence to your advantage

---

### 5-8 Players (Optimal)

**Dynamics:**
- Perfect balance of info and chaos
- Special roles shine here
- Multiple rounds of voting
- Best strategic depth

**Civilian Strategy:**
- Coordinate hints to triangulate
- Use voting patterns to identify the Munkeler
- Sheriff inspection is game-changing

**The Munkeler Strategy:**
- More hints to learn from
- Easier to blend in crowd
- Can survive multiple elimination rounds

**Jester Strategy:**
- Sweet spot for Jester play
- Enough chaos to be suspicious
- Not too obvious in the crowd

---

### 9-12 Players (Party Mode)

**Dynamics:**
- Information overload
- Harder to track everyone
- The Munkeler can hide easily
- Longer games (15-20 min)

**Civilian Strategy:**
- Focus on 2-3 most suspicious
- Don't try to analyze everyone
- Form voting blocks for efficiency

**The Munkeler Strategy:**
- Lay low early, blend in
- Lots of hints = easier to guess
- Survival is easier with more targets

**Sheriff Strategy:**
- Inspection is CRITICAL
- Too many players to deduce naturally
- Inspect early to narrow field

---

## Psychological Tactics

### Reading Players

**Hesitation Tells:**
- Long pauses before hints
- "Um" or "uh" excessively
- Looking at others for reassurance

**Overcompensation:**
- Too specific too early
- Overly confident tone
- Defensive without being accused

**Body Language (In-Person):**
- Avoiding eye contact
- Fidgeting when speaking
- Smiling/laughing nervously

### Deception Techniques

**The Truth Sandwich (Munkeler):**
- Give true statement + guess + true statement
- "It's common (true), it's red (guess), people use it (true)"
- Harder to identify the guess

**The Confident Lie:**
- Deliver vague hints with total confidence
- "Oh yeah, everyone knows this one"
- Confidence makes it seem like you know

**The Strategic Silence:**
- Let others talk first
- Learn from their hints
- Speak only when necessary

### Group Dynamics

**Early Game (Round 1):**
- Civilians: Vague hints, gather info
- Munkeler: Ultra vague, listen hard
- Jester: Slightly off hints

**Mid Game (Round 2-3):**
- Civilians: Coordinated narrowing
- Munkeler: Make your guess call
- Sheriff: Use your inspection

**End Game (2-4 players left):**
- Civilians: Direct accusations
- Munkeler: Survival or guess NOW
- Everyone: High tension decisions

## Topic-Specific Strategies

### Easy Topics (Food, Animals)

**Civilian:**
- Can be more specific (less risk of overlap)
- "It's a dairy product" is safe

**The Munkeler:**
- Easier to guess (common items)
- Use categories: "It's a breakfast food"

### Hard Topics (Chemistry, History)

**Civilian:**
- Be careful with specificity (obscure items)
- Focus on broad categories first

**The Munkeler:**
- Harder to guess (many possibilities)
- Survival strategy more viable
- Guess only with high confidence

### Custom/AI Topics

**Civilian:**
- Test topic familiarity first
- Some players might not know all items

**The Munkeler:**
- Hope for obscure items (harder for Civilians to describe)
- Generic hints blend better with confusion

---

## Winning Mindsets

### For All Roles

**Stay Calm Under Pressure**
- Panic makes you suspicious
- Think before speaking
- Confident delivery matters

**Adapt to Your Group**
- Serious players: strategic depth
- Casual group: have fun, less meta
- Kids: simpler hints, more guidance

**Learn from Each Game**
- What hints gave away the Munkeler?
- Which questions were most revealing?
- How did Jester win (or fail)?

### Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ **Civilians being too specific** → The Munkeler learns too fast  
❌ **The Munkeler asking direct questions** → Obvious tell  
❌ **Jester being too obvious** → Everyone knows, won't vote  
❌ **Sheriff wasting inspection** → Lost advantage  
❌ **Everyone voting randomly** → Chaos, no strategy  

### Pro-Level Play

[x] **Control information flow** - Share hints strategically  
[x] **Track voting patterns** - Who votes with whom  
[x] **Use process of elimination** - Narrow suspects systematically  
[x] **Time your reveals** - Sheriff inspection at perfect moment  
[x] **Meta-game awareness** - Remember previous rounds
