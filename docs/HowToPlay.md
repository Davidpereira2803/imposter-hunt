# How to Play

Imposter Hunt is a social deduction game. One player is the imposter and doesn’t see the secret word. Can you find them?

## Setup
- Add 3–12 players
- Choose a topic or generate with AI
- Optionally enable special roles (4+ players):
  - Jester: wins if eliminated
  - Sheriff: can inspect one player’s role once

## Roles
- Civilians: see the secret word, give subtle clues
- Imposter: doesn’t see the word, blends in and tries to guess it
- Jester: acts suspicious; wins if voted out
- Sheriff: on civilians’ team; inspects one player once

## Round
- Players give short, subtle hints (no direct word)
- Keep clues clear enough for civilians, vague enough to avoid an imposter guess

## Voting
- Vote to eliminate the suspected imposter
- Majority eliminates one player
- If the Jester gets eliminated, they win

## Imposter Guess
- At any time (or when prompted), the imposter can make a single final guess
- Exact match (case/accents/punctuation ignored) = imposter wins
- Wrong guess or pass = civilians win

## Win Conditions
- Civilians: eliminate the imposter
- Imposter: guess the word or survive to 2 players
- Jester: get eliminated
- Sheriff: helps civilians by inspecting one player

## Tips
- Civilians: avoid synonyms that reveal too much
- Imposter: mirror others’ confidence, avoid specifics
- Sheriff: time your inspection strategically
- Jester: be suspicious, not obvious

Enjoy!
