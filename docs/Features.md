## Special Roles System

Available with **4+ players** for enhanced strategy.

### The Jeste

**Win condition:** Get voted out

**Strategy:**
- Act suspicious without being obvious
- Give slightly off hints
- Make yourself a target
- Win alone if eliminated!

**Advanced tactics:**
- Vote erratically to draw attention
- Contradict yourself subtly
- Defend the actual Munkeler to seem guilty
- Time your suspicious behavior carefully

> The Jester adds a mind game layer — is that player really the Munkeler, or just trying to get eliminated?

### The Sheriff

**Ability:** Inspect one player's role (one-time use)

**Strategy:**
- Wait until you have 2-3 suspects
- Use before critical votes
- Share or hide your findings strategically
- Help civilians identify the real Munkeler

**Advanced tactics:**
- Bluff about when you've used your ability
- Inspect early to narrow suspects
- Save for endgame confirmation
- Don't reveal yourself too early (becomes a target)

> The Sheriff can turn the tide, but timing is everything.

### Role Combinations

With both roles enabled:
- Jester can pretend to be Sheriff
- Sheriff must identify Jester vs Munkeler
- Civilians can't trust suspicious behavior alone
- Creates complex psychological gameplay

## Smart Game Logic

### Voting System

**Majority Rules**
- Player with most votes is eliminated
- Requires more than 50% consensus

**Tie Handling**
- Automatic revote with only tied players
- If still tied, no elimination that round

**Jester Victory**
- If Jester eliminated, they win alone
- Game ends immediately
- Other players see Jester won

### Munkeler Guess Matching

**Smart Normalization**
- Case-insensitive ("Apple" = "apple")
- Ignores accents ("café" = "cafe")
- Strips punctuation ("don't" = "dont")
- Removes extra spaces

> Fair matching prevents losing on technicalities while keeping the challenge real.

### Win Condition Detection

**Multiple Paths to Victory:**

**Civilians Win If:**
- The Munkeler voted out
- The Munkeler guesses wrong

**The Munkeler Wins If:**
- Guesses secret word correctly
- Survives until 2 players remain

**Jester Wins If:**
- Gets eliminated in voting
- Solo victory (game ends)

**Sheriff:**
- Part of Civilian team
- Shares their victory
