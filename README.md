# How to Play Imposter Hunt

**Imposter Hunt** is a fast-paced social deduction game where players try to uncover who among them is the imposter — all on a single shared device.

## About the Game

Gather your friends and take turns passing the phone around. Everyone except one player receives a secret word from a chosen topic — but the **Imposter** has no clue!
Your goal: give hints, discuss, and vote out the impostor before they can figure out the word.

### How to Play

1. **Setup** – Add 3+ players and pick a topic (Food, Animals, Movies, Countries).
2. **Role Reveal** – Each player privately views their role (Civilian or Imposter).
3. **Discussion** – Give subtle hints and try to expose the Imposter.
4. **Voting** – Decide who to vote out each round.
5. **Results** – Either the Imposter wins by guessing the word or Civilians win by catching them!

### Win Conditions

* **Civilians Win**: The imposter is correctly voted out.
* **Imposter Wins**:

  * Correctly guesses the secret word.
  * Survives until only 2 players remain.
