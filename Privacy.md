# **Imposter Hunt – Privacy Policy**

*Last updated: October 2025*

Thank you for playing **Imposter Hunt**!
Your privacy is very important to us. This policy explains what data is (and isn’t) collected, how it’s used, and what third-party services are involved.

---

## **About Imposter Hunt**

**Imposter Hunt** is an offline, pass-and-play social game built with **React Native** and **Expo**.
The game does **not require an account, registration, or an internet connection** to play.
All gameplay data — such as player names, topics, and round results — is stored **locally on your device** and never sent to us or anyone else.

---

## **Data We Do Not Collect**

We do **not**:

* Collect, store, or transmit any personal data (e.g., name, email, phone number, or location)
* Use analytics, cookies, or user tracking libraries
* Access your contacts, camera, photos, microphone, or files

---

## **Advertising (Google AdMob)**

This app uses **Google AdMob** to display banner ads.
While we do not collect any personal data, AdMob may process limited **non-personal information** to serve and optimize ads.

This may include:

* Advertising identifiers (for frequency capping and performance)
* Approximate region or location (for regional relevance)
* Device type, operating system version, and language

These are handled under **Google’s Privacy Policy**, which you can review here:
👉 [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

If you are located in the **EU or UK**, the app will request your **ad consent** before showing any ads.
You can change or withdraw this consent at any time in your device’s **Ad Settings**.

---

## **Local Storage**

All game progress and player information are saved **only on your device** using local storage (`AsyncStorage`).
Removing or uninstalling the app deletes all stored data permanently.

---

## **Security**

Since Imposter Hunt does not send or store any data externally, there is **no remote data transmission**.
Your data security relies solely on your device’s built-in protections (e.g., screen lock, encryption, and OS security updates).

---

## **Developer Information**

**Imposter Hunt** is an independent project developed by **David Pereira** for entertainment and learning purposes.
