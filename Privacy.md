#### About Imposter Hunt

**Imposter Hunt** is an offline, pass-and-play social game built with **React Native** and **Expo**.
It does not require registration, login, or any internet connection to play.
All gameplay data (players, topics, rounds) stays locally on your device and is never sent to us or anyone else.

---

#### Data We Do Not Collect

We do **not**:

* Collect, store, or transmit personal data (such as name, email, phone, or location)
* Use analytics, cookies, or tracking libraries
* Access your contacts, photos, or files

---

#### Advertising

This app may display ads served by **Google AdMob**.

AdMob may collect certain **non-personal information** such as:

* Advertising identifiers (for frequency capping and ad performance)
* Approximate location (to deliver regionally relevant ads)
* Device type, OS version, and language

These are handled under Google’s **Privacy and Terms**, which you can review here:
[https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

If you are in the EU or UK, you will be asked for **ad consent** when you launch the app for the first time.
You can change or withdraw consent later using your device’s ad settings.

---

#### Local Storage

Game progress (player names, topics, rounds, etc.) is stored **only on your device** using local storage (AsyncStorage).
Deleting the app removes all data permanently.

---

#### Security

Since Imposter Hunt does not transmit data to any servers, there is no remote data storage or risk of online data leaks.
Your local device security (screen lock, OS updates) protects your saved progress.
